# eventbot
Discord bot to streamline the organization of events for the members of a server.

## Dependencies
* python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* discord.py rewrite (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/index.html#)
* mongoDB (local or hosted)
* pymongo==3.7.1 (https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/)
* pytz==2017.2 (http://pytz.sourceforge.net/)
* dateparser==0.7.0 (https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)

## Installation
The bot is currently configured for hosting using Heroku and Mlab (free tiers for both are fine). 
To host on a local machine:
    
    1. Check that all the dependencies are satisfied. (Ensure mongodb service is running)
    
    2. Create a 'bot_token.txt' file with your bot's token in a directory above the script (or change the path manually)
    
    3. Change the flag `HEROKU` to False
    
    4. cd to the path this file is in and run `python eventbot.py` 
    
You can create a bot user and get a token at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/

## Commands
Run `!help` after adding the bot to your server.
